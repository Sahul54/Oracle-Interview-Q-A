#  Differance between SQL, MYSQL and Oracle?

## Ans: SQL, MySQL, and Oracle are all relational database management systems (RDBMS). They all use the SQL language to manage data, but there are some key differences between them.

## SQL is a language for defining, manipulating, and querying data in relational databases. It is a standard language, so it can be used with any RDBMS.
## MySQL is an open-source RDBMS that is based on SQL. It is a popular choice for small to medium-sized businesses because it is free and easy to use.
## Oracle is a commercial RDBMS that is more powerful and scalable than MySQL. It is a popular choice for large enterprises because it can handle high volumes of data and complex queries.
Here is a table that summarizes the key differences between SQL, MySQL, and Oracle:


Ultimately, the best RDBMS for you will depend on your specific needs and requirements. If you are looking for a free and easy-to-use RDBMS for small to medium-sized businesses, MySQL is a good option. If you are looking for a more powerful and scalable RDBMS for large enterprises, Oracle is a good option.

Here are some additional things to consider when choosing an RDBMS:

Your budget: How much are you willing to spend on an RDBMS?
Your needs: How much data do you need to store? How many users will be accessing your database? What kind of queries will you be running?
Your skills: How much experience do you have with RDBMS?
Your support needs: Do you need help with installation, configuration, or troubleshooting?
